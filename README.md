# Overview

The software is a console-based To-Do List Manager application written in C++. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, viewing, and removing them. Users can also categorize tasks by priority or due date and save their task list to a file, which can later be loaded to retrieve saved tasks. This demonstrates fundamental C++ programming concepts, such as classes, functions, STL containers, file handling, and conditionals.

## Purpose

The purpose of writing this software was to demonstrate proficiency in C++ and explore object-oriented programming principles in a practical application. Through this project, I aimed to practice working with C++ Standard Template Library (STL) data structures like vectors and maps, as well as file I/O operations. Additionally, this project allowed me to implement and enhance skills in modular code design, creating a user-friendly interface, and managing memory efficiently.

# Development Environment

I developed the To-Do List Manager using Visual Studio Code with the Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) compiler. Visual Studio Code provided an efficient, lightweight environment, while MSVC ensured reliable compilation and debugging support for C++ on Windows.

# Future Work

- Sort Tasks: Add functionality to sort tasks by priority or due date for easier viewing and management
- Backup and Restore: Create options to back up task data automatically and restore from backups in case of data loss.
- Enhanced User Interface: Improve the console interface by adding clearer formatting and additional user prompts to make navigation more intuitive.
